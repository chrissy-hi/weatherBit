# WeatherBit API Microsesrvice
This is a microservice that I have created for CS 361. This microservice will be implemented by my partner in their program. 

<header>Communication Contract</header>
Communication with this microservice will be done using REST API calls. 

If I make changes to this code I will communicate the changes to my partner and update this ReadMe to reflect correct and current funcitonality. 
If my partner requests any part of this code to be changed to aid in the implementation of her program, I will update the code and update this ReadMe to reflect correct and current functionality.
